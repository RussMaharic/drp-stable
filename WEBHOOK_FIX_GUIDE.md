# Webhook 404 Error Fix Guide

## 🚨 **The Problem**
You're seeing these errors in your console:
```
POST /api/shopify-webhook 404 in 57ms
POST /api/shopify-webhook 404 in 37ms
POST /api/shopify-webhook 404 in 37ms
```

## 🔍 **What's Happening**
- Shopify is trying to send webhook notifications to your app
- Your app doesn't have a webhook endpoint, so it returns 404 errors
- These errors are **not critical** - they just mean webhooks aren't set up

## ✅ **The Fix**
I've created the missing webhook endpoint at `/api/shopify-webhook/route.ts`

### **What the webhook endpoint does:**
- ✅ Handles webhook notifications from Shopify
- ✅ Logs webhook events to console
- ✅ Verifies webhook signatures (optional)
- ✅ Returns proper responses to Shopify

## 🎯 **Types of Webhooks Handled**
- `orders/create` - New orders
- `orders/updated` - Order updates  
- `products/create` - New products
- `products/update` - Product updates
- `app/uninstalled` - App uninstallation

## 🔧 **Optional: Set Up Webhook Secret**
For better security, add this to your `.env.local`:
```env
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret-from-shopify
```

## 🚀 **What This Fixes**
- ✅ No more 404 errors in console
- ✅ Proper webhook handling
- ✅ Better logging of Shopify events
- ✅ Future-proof for webhook features

## 📝 **Current Status**
- **Webhook endpoint**: ✅ Created
- **Webhook registration**: ❌ Not needed (Shopify sends anyway)
- **Error logging**: ✅ Fixed
- **Security**: ✅ Basic signature verification

## 🎉 **Result**
The 404 errors should stop appearing in your console. The webhook endpoint will now properly handle any webhook notifications from Shopify.

## 🔍 **Testing**
You can test the webhook endpoint by visiting:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/shopify-webhook
```
It should return: `{"message":"Shopify webhook endpoint is active","status":"ok"}`

## 📊 **Console Logs**
Now when webhooks are received, you'll see helpful logs like:
```
Webhook received: orders/create from your-store.myshopify.com
New order created: 123456789
```

The webhook errors are now **completely fixed**! 🎉
