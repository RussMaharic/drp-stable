# Fixes Applied - Shopify Integration & Authentication

## ðŸŽ¯ **Issues Fixed:**

### **1. âœ… Shopify Token Usage**
- **Problem**: Push to Shopify was using in-memory tokens instead of stored Supabase tokens
- **Fix**: Updated `/api/push-to-shopify/route.ts` and `/api/shopify-products/route.ts` to use `TokenManager.getToken(shop)`
- **Result**: Now uses persistent tokens from Supabase database

### **2. âœ… Persistent Authentication**
- **Problem**: Getting logged out repeatedly due to aggressive redirect logic
- **Fix**: Updated supplier layout to only redirect when actually missing supplier name
- **Result**: Stays logged in until manually logging out

### **3. âœ… Seller Dashboard Logout**
- **Problem**: Missing logout functionality in seller dashboard
- **Fix**: Added logout button to seller dashboard dropdown menu
- **Result**: Can now logout from seller dashboard

## ðŸš€ **How to Test:**

### **1. Test Shopify Integration**
1. **Connect to Shopify** (if not already connected)
2. **Create a product** in supplier dashboard
3. **Go to seller dashboard** - should see your product
4. **Click "Push to Shopify"** - should work now with stored token
5. **Check Shopify store** - product should appear

### **2. Test Authentication**
1. **Login as supplier** - enter supplier name
2. **Navigate between pages** - should stay logged in
3. **Refresh page** - should remain logged in
4. **Use logout button** - should properly logout

### **3. Test Seller Dashboard**
1. **Go to seller dashboard**
2. **Click user avatar** (top right)
3. **Click "Logout"** - should logout and redirect to home

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Changes:**

### **API Routes Updated:**
- `app/api/push-to-shopify/route.ts` - Now uses `TokenManager.getToken()`
- `app/api/shopify-products/route.ts` - Now uses `TokenManager.getToken()`

### **Layout Components Updated:**
- `components/dashboard-layout.tsx` - Added logout functionality
- `app/supplier/layout.tsx` - Fixed authentication logic

### **Token Management:**
- Uses `TokenManager.getToken(shop)` to get stored tokens
- Tokens persist in Supabase `shopify_tokens` table
- No more in-memory token dependency

## âœ… **Expected Behavior:**

### **Shopify Integration:**
- âœ… Push to Shopify works with stored tokens
- âœ… Connection status shows correctly
- âœ… Products sync to Shopify store

### **Authentication:**
- âœ… Stay logged in until manual logout
- âœ… No more constant redirects
- âœ… Logout works from both dashboards

### **Data Persistence:**
- âœ… Tokens stored in Supabase
- âœ… Products saved to database
- âœ… Images uploaded to storage

## ðŸŽ¯ **Ready to Test!**

**All major issues have been resolved:**
- Shopify integration now works with persistent tokens
- Authentication is stable and persistent
